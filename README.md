# Shut-the-box

Shut the box is a dice playing game (just google it). This program plays the game always seeking to turn down the highest possible tiles per roll and records the results in a user specified file. I wrote the game to figure out how likely one is to win, and according to this program it works out to be about 4 wins per thousand games. So not too likely.
